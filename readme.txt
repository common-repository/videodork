Embed XHTML-compatible YouTube and Gametrailers videos easily.

== Description ==

Anybody who wants to keep their site XHTML-compatible knows that the embedding codes YouTube and Gametrailers provide you with include XHTML errors. The WordPress plugins based on these codes don't fix these errors; that's why VideoDork was developed. Now you can easily embed the videos by just posting their URL in your posts, and your site will still validate against the current Web standards.

The plugin supports only YouTube and Gametrailers videos yet - if you'd like it to allow embedding videos from your favourite site, [let me know](http://regua.biz/contact "contact the author") and I'll do it ASAP. Note that the plugin will accept links with or without `www.`, with or without a slash `/` at the end, YouTube videos from around the world (the YouTube domain doesn't matter, be it youtube.com, youtube.co.uk, or youtube.pl) and allows you to embed both the casual Gametrailers videos as well as the community-created ones.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory `videodork` to the `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the plugin? =

Just post a link to your video in square brackets [], for example [http://youtube.com/watch?v=qHO8l-Bd1O4] or [http://www.gametrailers.com/player/30798.html]. The plugin will detect these kind of links in your posts and automatically change them into embedded videos.

= How to embed videos from other sites with the plugin? =

[Let me know](http://regua.biz/contact "contact the author") and I'll add the requested functionality to the plugin as soon as I can. You can also edit the `videodork.php` file in the plugin's main directory and add a regular expression that will search for the links in the posts' content.
